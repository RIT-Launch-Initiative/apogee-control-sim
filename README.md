# apogee-control-sim
Simulations for RIT Launch's prototype apogee control system. 

The first prototype's control scheme is derived from that used by SAC-2024 Team
97 'ARES', in creating a LUT-based model-predictive controller using offline
simulations. 

Thank you to UoM ARES for making their work publicly available.
